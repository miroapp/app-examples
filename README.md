Welcome to Miro App Examples! In this repository you can find examples of apps built on top of the Miro Developer Platform 2.0.<br />
Make sure you visit our [developer documentation](https://developers.miro.com) to learn more.

**&nbsp;â„¹&nbsp;Note**:

- We recommend a Chromium-based web browser for local development with HTTP. \
  Safari enforces HTTPS; therefore, it doesn't allow localhost through HTTP.
- All examples use `npm` as a package manager and `npx` as a package runner. \
  If you prefer, you can install and use equivalent alternatives, such as `yarn` or `pnpm`.
- For more information, visit our [developer documentation](https://developers.miro.com).

### Miro Web SDK

The fastest way to bootstrap a new app is by using [`create-miro-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-miro-app).<br />
To get started, run the following command:

```shell
npx create-miro-app
```
