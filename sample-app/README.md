# Sample Miro app

Handy playground for playing with Miro Board API and Web-plugins.

### How to use

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run start`
3. Run `npm run ngrok` in another terminal
4. Edit `src/config.js`:
   - Set BASE_URL from ngrok
   - Set CLIENT_ID from the App settings
   - Set CLIENT_SECRET from the App settings
5. Open app landing (url from ngrok, like https://--------.ngrok.io)
6. Configure web-plugin â€” set iframe url in App settings
7. Explore it

### How it works

`app.js` is the entry point

`api.js` contains methods for work with API

`config.js` contains configs, edit this file before usage

`events.js` process webhook events

`db.js` is simple DataBase which works with file database.txt
