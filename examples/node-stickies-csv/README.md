# ✅ Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

- You have a [Miro account](https://miro.com/signup/).
- You're [signed in to Miro](https://miro.com/login/).
- Your Miro account has a [Developer team](https://developers.miro.com/docs/create-a-developer-team).
- Your development environment includes [Node.js 14.13](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or a later version.
- All examples use `npm` as a package manager and `npx` as a package runner.

# 🏃🏽‍♂️ Run the app locally <a name="run"></a>

1. Rename the `.sample.env` file to `.env` and then add in your environmental variables. Once completed your `.env` file should
   look something like this:

```
MIRO_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
MIRO_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>
MIRO_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:8000/authorized
MIRO_BOARD_ID=<YOUR_MIRO_BOARD_ID>
```

> MIRO_BOARD_ID can be found [here](https://community.miro.com/developer-platform-and-apis-57/where-can-i-find-board-id-3154).

2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start developing. \
   Your URL should be similar to this example:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```
4. Open the [app manifest editor](https://developers.miro.com/docs/manually-create-an-app#step-2-configure-your-app-in-miro) by clicking **Edit in Manifest**. \

In the app manifest editor, configure the app as follows and click save:

```yaml
# See https://developers.miro.com/docs/app-manifest on how to use this
appName: Node Stickes CSV
sdkVersion: SDK_V2
sdkUri: http://localhost:8000
redirectUris: http://localhost:8000/authorized/
scopes:
  - boards:read
  - boards:write
```

5. Go back to your app home page, and under the `Permissions` section, you will see a blue button that says `Install app and get OAuth token`. Click that button. Then click on `Add` as shown in the video below. <b>In the video we install a different app, but the process is the same regardless of the app.</b>

> ⚠️ We recommend to install your app on a [developer team](https://developers.miro.com/docs/create-a-developer-team) while you are developing or testing apps.⚠️

6. Go to the developer team which you installed the app on, and open the board with the board ID matching your board from the .env file: `MIRO_BOARD_ID=<YOUR_MIRO_BOARD_ID>`.

7. Next, go to `localhost:8000`, and click on `Authorize App`.

8. Go through the authorization process, then click on `List Stickies` or any of the other buttons at the top to interact with the app.
