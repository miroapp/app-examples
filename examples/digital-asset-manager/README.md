# 📖 Associated Developer Tutorials <a name="tutorial"></a>
> To view a more in depth developer tutorial
of this app (including code explanations) see the [digital asset manager tutorial](https://developers.miro.com/docs/integrate-a-digital-asset-manager-in-miro) and [search and filter tutorial](https://developers.miro.com/docs/adding-search-and-filter-to-an-sdk-app) on Miro's Developer documentation.

# 🏃🏽‍♂️ Run the app locally <a name="run"></a>

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` to start developing. \
   Your URL should be similar to this example:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
3. Open the [app manifest editor](https://developers.miro.com/docs/manually-create-an-app#step-2-configure-your-app-in-miro) by clicking **Edit in Manifest**. \
   In the app manifest editor, configure the app as follows:
   - [`sdkUri`](https://developers.miro.com/docs/app-manifest#sdkuri): assign `http://localhost:3000` as a value for this property. \
     It defines the entry point of the app, and it corresponds to the URL of the server that the app runs on.
   - [`scopes`](https://developers.miro.com/docs/app-manifest#scopes): add the permission scopes that users need to grant the app when they install it. \
     To enable the app to read from and write to the board, add the following permissions:
     - `boards:read`
     - `boards:write`

4. Go back to your app home page, and under the `Permissions` section, you will see a blue button that says `Install app and get OAuth token`. Click that button. Then click on `Add` as shown in the video below.

> ⚠️ We recommend to install your app on a [developer team](https://developers.miro.com/docs/create-a-developer-team) while you are developing or testing apps.⚠️

5. Go to your developer team, and open your boards.
6. Click on the plus icon from the bottom section of your left sidebar. If you hover over it, it will say `More apps`.
7. Search for your app `Digital Asset Manager` or whatever you chose to name it. Click on your app to use it, as shown in the video below.
