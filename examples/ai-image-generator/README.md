- You're [signed in to Miro](https://miro.com/login/).
- Your Miro account has a [Developer team](https://developers.miro.com/docs/create-a-developer-team).
- Your development environment includes [Node.js 14.13](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or a later version.

# 🏃🏽‍♂️ Run the app locally <a name="run"></a>

1. Rename the `.env.sample` file to `.env` and add in [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys),
   client ID and client secret, and save the file.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

3. Open the [app manifest editor](https://developers.miro.com/docs/manually-create-an-app#step-2-configure-your-app-in-miro) by clicking **Edit in Manifest**. \
   In the app manifest editor, configure the app as follows and then `click save`.

```yaml
appName: AI Image Generator
sdkVersion: SDK_V2
sdkUri: http://localhost:3000
redirectUris:
  - http://localhost:3000/api/redirect
redirectUriForSdk: http://localhost:3000/api/redirect
scopes:
  - boards:read
  - boards:write
```

4. Run `npm start`.
   Your URL should be similar to this example:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

   Go to the URL and go through the OAuth flow and install the app on a dev team.

   > ⚠️ We recommend to install your app on a [developer team](https://developers.miro.com/docs/create-a-developer-team) while you are developing or testing apps.⚠️

5. Go to your developer team, and open your boards.
6. Click on the plus icon from the bottom section of your left sidebar. If you hover over it, it will say `More apps`.
7. Search for your app `AI Image Generator` or whatever you chose to name it. Click on your app to use it, as shown in the video below.
