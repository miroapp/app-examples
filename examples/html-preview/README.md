# ✅ Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

- You have a [Miro account](https://miro.com/signup/).
- You're [signed in to Miro](https://miro.com/login/).
- Your Miro account has a [Developer team](https://developers.miro.com/docs/create-a-developer-team).
- Your development environment includes [Node.js 14.13](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or a later version.
- All examples use `npm` as a package manager and `npx` as a package runner.

# 🏃🏽‍♂️ Run the app locally <a name="run"></a>

1. Rename the `.sample.env` file to `.env` and then add in your environmental variables. Once completed your `.env` file should
   look something like this:

```
MIRO_CLIENT_ID=12345678910
MIRO_CLIENT_SECRET=abcdefghizklmnop12345678910
MIRO_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/redirect/
```

2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start developing. \
   Your URL should be similar to this example:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
4. Open the [app manifest editor](https://developers.miro.com/docs/manually-create-an-app#step-2-configure-your-app-in-miro) by clicking **Edit in Manifest**. \
   In the app manifest editor, configure the app as follows:

   - [`sdkUri`](https://developers.miro.com/docs/app-manifest#sdkuri): assign `http://localhost:3000` as a value for this property. \
   - [`redirectUris`](https://developers.miro.com/docs/app-manifest?utm_source=app_manifest_editor#redirecturis): assign `http://localhost:3000/api/redirect/` as a value for this property. \
   - [`redirectUriForSdk`](https://developers.miro.com/docs/app-manifest?utm_source=app_manifest_editor#redirecturiforsdk): assign `http://localhost:3000/api/redirect/` as a value for this property. \
     It defines the entry point of the app, and it corresponds to the URL of the server that the app runs on.
   - [`scopes`](https://developers.miro.com/docs/app-manifest#scopes): add the permission scopes that users need to grant the app when they install it. \
     To enable the app to read from and write to the board, add the following permissions:
     - `boards:read`
     - `boards:write`

5. Go back to your app home page, and under the `Permissions` section, you will see a blue button that says `Install app and get OAuth token`. Click that button. Then click on `Add` as shown in the video below.

> ⚠️ We recommend to install your app on a [developer team](https://developers.miro.com/docs/create-a-developer-team) while you are developing or testing apps.⚠️

6. Go to your developer team, and open your boards.
7. Click on the plus icon from the bottom section of your left sidebar. If you hover over it, it will say `More apps`.
8. Search for your app `HTML Preview App` or whatever you chose to name it. Click on your app to use it, as shown in the video below.
