## YouTube room

**&nbsp;ℹ&nbsp;Note**:

- Developing the app involves creating 2 separate apps, and testing them with different user sessions. \
  We recommend opening 2 browser sessions with different users to test the full functionality of the app.
- We recommend a Chromium-based web browser for local development with HTTP. \
  Safari enforces HTTPS; therefore, it doesn't allow localhost through HTTP.
- All examples use `npm` as a package manager and `npx` as a package runner. \
  If you prefer, you can install and use equivalent alternatives, such as `yarn` or `pnpm`.
- For more information, visit our [developer documentation](https://developers.miro.com).

This Miro Web SDK app shows you how you can sync multiple YouTube players across different user sessions. \
The example uses an [Express server](https://expressjs.com/) and [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/), a library to implement a [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) in web applications. \
The app can be useful for teachers, workshop presenters, and others looking to broadcast a video to multiple users on the same board.

### How it works

This example contains 2 separate apps that are connected by a WebSocket:

- A facilitator app, and
- A participant app.

Each app serves different purposes that enable the functionality of the YouTube room.

#### Facilitator

This app is meant to be installed by only one user: the facilitator of the Miro board. \
It contains the functionality to start, update, and change a YouTube video. The video is in turn broadcasted and synced across all participants.

#### Participant

This app can be installed by multiple users. It contains the functionality that keeps the YouTube player in sync with the facilitator app.

### How to start locally

- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to start developing. \
  Your URL should be similar to this example:
  ```
  http://localhost:3000
  ```
- [Create a new Miro app](https://developers.miro.com/docs/build-your-first-hello-world-app#step-3-create-your-app-in-miro) for the facilitator app component.
- Paste `http://localhost:3000/facilitator` in the `App URL` box in your Facilitator app settings.
- [Create a new Miro app](https://developers.miro.com/docs/build-your-first-hello-world-app#step-3-create-your-app-in-miro) for the participant app component.
- Paste `http://localhost:3000/participant` in the `App URL` box in your participant app settings.
- Open a board and click the three dots (...) or the chevron (>>) on the left toolbar. You should see the Miro calendar app.

### Folder structure

This is an overview of important files in this example.

```
.
├── src
│  └── assets
│      └── style.css <-- CSS styles for the app.
│  └── facilitator-modal.js <-- Connects to the WebSocket, and syncronizes other participant apps.
│      facilitator.js <-- Initializes the facilitator app in Miro
│      participant-modal.js <-- Connects to the WebSocket, and syncronizes the YouTube player with the facilitator app.
│      participant.js <-- Initializes the participant app in Miro
├── facilitator-modal.html <-- The HTML for the facilitator app modal
├── facilitator.html <-- The HTML for the facilitator app
├── participant-modal.html <-- The HTML for the participant app modal
├── participant.html <-- The HTML for the participant app
└── server.js <-- The main server. This serves the HTML for both apps. It also initiates the WebSocket.
```

### How to use the app

Using both the facilitator and participant app is straightforward. Continue reading below to read a short description on how each of them work. \
[Watch a video to see how they work](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HTZFf8bkNI).

#### Facilitator

By opening the facilitator app, you'll be greeted with a modal that allows you to paste a YouTube URL in. After selecting the desired video, you're able to click the "Open Video for Participants" button, and in turn a modal will open on all of the participants boards that have the participant app installed.

As a facilitator, you can play, pause, and stop the video, go to a new point, as well as completely replace the video with a different one. \
Each of these actions is reflected in the participant app's modal.

#### Participant

After installing the participant app, no further setup in required. It will work out of the box, and a modal will appear with a YouTube video whenever the facilitator of the room starts presenting.

### How to build the app

When you're done developing your app, you will need to build your app before you can deploy it.

- Run `npm run build`. \
  This generates a static output inside `dist/`, which you can host on a static hosting service.

### How to deploy your app

When you're done building your app, you will need to deploy your app before you can use it in production. \
Host the built project on a service like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).
