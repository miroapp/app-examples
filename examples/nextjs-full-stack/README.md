# ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy the app on AWS Amplify <a name="deploy"></a>

If you want to understand how to deploy the app to AWS Amplify, please watch the video below. Otherwise,
skip to the next section to see how to run this locally.

# üèÉüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run the app locally <a name="run"></a>

1. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.

2. Rename the `.sample.env` file to `.env` and then add in your clientID, client Secret, and keep the redirect URL the same.

3. Open the [app manifest editor](https://developers.miro.com/docs/manually-create-an-app#step-2-configure-your-app-in-miro) by clicking **Edit in Manifest**. \
   In the app manifest editor, copy and paste the following yaml code:

```yaml
# See https://developers.miro.com/docs/app-manifest on how to use this
appName: Webcam Screenshot
sdkUri: "http://localhost:3000"
redirectUris:
  - http://localhost:3000/api/redirect/
scopes:
  - boards:read
  - boards:write
  - webcam:record
```

4. Go back to your app home page, and under the `Permissions` section, you will see a blue button that says `Install app and get OAuth token`. Click that button. Then click on `Add` as shown in the video below. <b>In the video we install a different app, but the process is the same regardless of the app.</b>

> ‚ö†Ô∏è We recommend to install your app on a [developer team](https://developers.miro.com/docs/create-a-developer-team) while you are developing or testing apps.‚ö†Ô∏è

https://github.com/miroapp/app-examples/assets/10428517/1e6862de-8617-46ef-b265-97ff1cbfe8bf

5. Run `yarn dev`.

6. Go to your developer team, and open your boards.
7. Click on the plus icon from the bottom section of your left sidebar. If you hover over it, it will say `More apps`.
8. Search for your app `Webcam Screenshot` or whatever you chose to name it. Click on your app to use it, as shown in the video below. <b>In the video we search for a different app, but the process is the same regardless of the app.</b>

> ‚ö†Ô∏è In case of error `401` returned by a REST API request, remove the `miro_tokens` cookie for the `localhost`
> domain in the browser:
>
> <img alt="Chrome's DevTools cookies delete" src="https://github.com/miroapp/app-examples/raw/main/assets/devtools-cookie-delete.png" />
>
> In the example, the access token refresh functionality has not been implemented to keep the implementation
> simple and focused on the topic.
