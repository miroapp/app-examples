# JWT Authentication with Miro

This app shows how to add Miro user's signature to API requests using JWT token.
The app uses the Miro Web SDK method `getIdToken` to identify a user on server side to read and update user's recent GIFs.

# ✅ Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

- You have a [Miro account](https://miro.com/signup/).
- You're [signed in to Miro](https://miro.com/login/).
- Your Miro account has a [Developer team](https://developers.miro.com/docs/create-a-developer-team).
- Your development environment includes [Node.js 18.17](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or a later version.
- All examples use `npm` as a package manager and `npx` as a package runner.

# 🏃🏽‍♂️ Run the app locally <a name="run"></a>

1. Rename the ['.env.example' file](.env.example) to `.env`. You will need to create a Miro app and then add in the client ID and client secret.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start developing. \
   Your URL should be similar to this example:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
4. Open the [app manifest editor](https://developers.miro.com/docs/manually-create-an-app#step-2-configure-your-app-in-miro) by clicking **Edit in Manifest**. \
   In the app manifest editor, configure the app as follows:

   - [`appName`](): change it to `JWT demo` or whatever you want to name your app.
   - [`sdkUri`](https://developers.miro.com/docs/app-manifest#sdkuri): assign `http://localhost:3000` as a value for this property.
   - [`scopes`](https://developers.miro.com/docs/app-manifest#scopes): add the permission scopes that users need to grant the app when they install it.
     To enable the app to write to the board, add the following permissions:
     - `boards:read`

5. Go back to your app home page, and under the `Permissions` section, you will see a blue button that says `Install app and get OAuth token`. Click that button. Then click on `Add` as shown in the video below.

> ⚠️ We recommend to install your app on a [developer team](https://developers.miro.com/docs/create-a-developer-team) while you are developing or testing apps.⚠️

6. Go to your developer team, and open your boards.
7. Click on the plus icon from the bottom section of your left sidebar. If you hover over it, it will say `More apps`.
8. Search for your app `JWT demo` or whatever you chose to name it. Click on your app to use it, as shown in the video below.
