## Blob maker app

**&nbsp;ℹ&nbsp;Note**:

- To make drag and drop available in this example, deploy the app to a publicly accessible location. \
  In this example, drag and drop functionality doesn't work if you serve the app on localhost.
- We recommend a Chromium-based web browser for local development with HTTP. \
  Safari enforces HTTPS; therefore, it doesn't allow localhost through HTTP.
- All examples use `npm` as a package manager and `npx` as a package runner. \
  If you prefer, you can install and use equivalent alternatives, such as `yarn` or `pnpm`.
- For more information about implementing [drag and drop](https://developers.miro.com/docs/add-drag-and-drop-to-your-app), visit our [developer documentation](https://developers.miro.com).

### How to start locally

- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to start developing. \
  Your URL should be similar to this example:
  ```
  http://localhost:3000
  ```
- Paste the URL under **App URL** in your [app settings](https://developers.miro.com/docs/build-your-first-hello-world-app#step-3-create-your-app-in-miro).
- Open a board; you should see your app in the app toolbar or in the **Apps** panel.

### How to start with Glitch

[Glitch Documentation](https://help.glitch.com/kb/article/20-importing-code-from-github/)

- Create a Glitch account if you do not have one already.
- Click **New Project**.
- You should be able to select the option **Import from GitHub**.
- You can copy this app folder into a new GitHub repo and use this URL, or you can use [https://github.com/CharlieWinters/miro-blob-maker](https://github.com/CharlieWinters/miro-blob-maker).
- After the app starts up, it will have a unique URL that will serve the app over HTTPS. \
  Click **Preview** in the bottom bar, and then **Preview in a new window**.
- You should see **Great, your app is running locally!**. Copy the URL.
- Paste the URL under **App URL** in your [app settings](https://developers.miro.com/docs/build-your-first-hello-world-app#step-3-create-your-app-in-miro).
- Open a board; you should see your app in the app toolbar or in the **Apps** panel.

### How to build the app

- Run `npm run build`. \
  This generates a static output inside `dist/`, which you can host on a static hosting service.

### Folder structure

```
.
├── src
│  ├── assets
│  │  └── style.css
│  ├── app.js      // The code for the app lives here
│  └── index.js    // The code for the app entry point lives here
├── app.html       // The app itself. It's loaded on the board inside the 'appContainer'
└── index.html     // The app entry point. This is what you specify in the 'App URL' box in the Miro app settings
```

### About the app

This sample app shows how you can create dynamic blob SVGs on the fly, and drag and drop them onto a Miro board.
