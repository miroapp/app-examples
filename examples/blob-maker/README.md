# Blob Maker App

## How to start locally (Drag and drop functionality will not work locally see below):

- Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `yarn start` or `npm start` to start developing, you should have a URL
  that looks like this

```
http://localhost:3000
```

- Paste the URL in `App URL` in your app settings
- open a board & you should see your app in the main toolbar when you click the
  three dots.

**CAVEAT: the drag and drop functionality will not work when the app is served on localhost.**

**If you would like to use app to its full functionality you will need to deploy the app to a publically accessible location.**
