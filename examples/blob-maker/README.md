# Miro Blob Maker App

This app shows how to create dynamic blob SVGs on the fly, which you can then drag and drop to a Miro board.

⚠️ <b>Note that the drag and drop part of the app only works with a public URL, so you will need to use Glitch or another service to host your app!</b> ⚠️

# 🏃🏽‍♂️ Run the app locally (Not Recommended) <a name="run"></a>

⚠️ <b>Note that the drag and drop part of the app only works with a public URL, so you will need to
use Glitch or another service to host your app!</b> ⚠️ It is recommended to deploy this on Glitch. See
next section below for more details.

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` to start developing. \
   Your URL should be similar to this example:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
3. Open the [app manifest editor](https://developers.miro.com/docs/manually-create-an-app#step-2-configure-your-app-in-miro) by clicking **Edit in Manifest**. \
    In the app manifest editor, configure the app as follows:

   ```yaml
   appName: Blob Maker
   sdkUri: "http://localhost:3000"
   scopes:
     - boards:read
     - boards:write
   ```

You can read more about Miro's [app manifest on the developer documentation](https://developers.miro.com/docs/app-manifest).

4. Go back to your app home page, and under the `Permissions` section, you will see a blue button that says `Install app and get OAuth token`. Click that button. Then click on `Add` as shown in the video below. <b>In the video we install a different app, but the process is the same regardless of the app.</b>

> ⚠️ We recommend to install your app on a [developer team](https://developers.miro.com/docs/create-a-developer-team) while you are developing or testing apps.⚠️

5. Go to your developer team, and open your boards.
6. Click on the plus icon from the bottom section of your left sidebar. If you hover over it, it will say `More apps`.
7. Search for your app `Blob Maker` or whatever you chose to name it. Click on your app to use it, as shown in the video below.

# 🏃🏽‍♂️ Run the app on Glitch (Recommended) <a name="run"></a>

1. Create a [Glitch account](https://glitch.com/) if you do not have one already.
2. Click New Project.
3. You should be able to select the option "Import from Github".
4. You can copy this app folder into a new github repo and use this url or you can use https://github.com/CharlieWinters/miro-blob-maker
5. After the app starts up, it will have a unique url that will serve the app over https. Click "Preview" in the bottom bar and then "Preview in a new window".
6. You should see "Great, your app is running locally", copy the url.
7. Go into your app settings, and click on edit manifest.
8. Add your public URL to your manifest like so:

```yaml

boardPicker:
  allowedDomains: []
redirectUris: []
redirectUriForSdk: ""
scopes:
