# OAuth 2.0 Node.js App Example (With Ngrok)

This app shows how to implement the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant flow (using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/) for our redirect URL) to make Miro REST API calls.

# ✅ Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

- Create a [new app in Miro](https://miro.com/app/settings/user-profile/apps)
- You have a [Miro account](https://miro.com/signup/).
- You're [signed in to Miro](https://miro.com/login/).
- Your Miro account has a [Developer team](https://developers.miro.com/docs/create-a-developer-team).
- Your development environment includes [Node.js 14.13](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or a later version.
- All examples use `npm` as a package manager and `npx` as a package runner.
- Install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

# 📖 Associated Developer Tutorial <a name="tutorial"></a>

> To view a more in depth developer tutorial

# 🏃🏽‍♂️ Run the app with ngrok <a name="run"></a>

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

2. Run `ngrok http 3000` and copy the forwarding address. It should look something like:

`https://1ce8-45-94-204-74.ngrok-free.app`. This will be the value for `redirectURL` in your `.env` file.

3. Rename the `.sample.env` file to `.env` and then fill in the values.

> To find your client ID and secret, go to `Your apps`, and then select the app you just created to access its settings page. On the app settings page, go to `App Credentials`, and copy the app Client ID and Client secret values.
> To find your `boardId` Go to your desired Miro board, copy the board ID from the URL, and paste it to your .env file boardId variable. For more info on how to get your board ID, see the [community question](https://community.miro.com/developer-platform-and-apis-57/where-can-i-find-board-id-3154).
> The `redirectURL` is just the forwarding address from step 2. Once your `.env` file is completed, it should look similar to this:

```
clientID=12345678910
clientSecret=12345678910abcdefg
redirectURL=https://01-11-11-2011-74.ngrok-free.app
boardId=abcdefghik=
```

4. Open the [app manifest editor](https://developers.miro.com/docs/manually-create-an-app#step-2-configure-your-app-in-miro) by clicking **Edit in Manifest**. \
   In the app manifest editor, copy and paste the following yaml code:

```yaml
# See https://developers.miro.com/docs/app-manifest on how to use this
appName: OAuth2.0 with NodeJS
redirectUris:
  - https://[YOUR_NGROK_URL].ngrok-free.app
scopes:
  - boards:read
```

> <b>Note, your `redirectUris` should be different than mine, it's just the forwarding address from ngrok. Make sure
> both are the same in your app settings and in your `.env` file</b>

5. Run `npm run start` to start the server.

6. Once your server is running, copy the installation URL of your app under `Share App` in the app settings UI and paste it in
   your browser. This should take you to the Miro OAuth page. Select your dev team, and then click `Add`. <b>You can see this step done in the App Demo at the top of the README.</b>

7. This should take you to your `redirect URL` now. You should now see `Hello, World!` and `Miro API Response:` in your browser.
   Great job! You've completed this app example! <b>You can see this step done in the App Demo at the top of the README.</b>
