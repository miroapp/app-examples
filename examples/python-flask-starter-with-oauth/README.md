1. Install the project dependenciesAwes by running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
2. Create your `.env` file by copying the template, and use it to store your credentials:
   ```
   cp sample.env .env
   ```
3. In your account profile, go to **Your apps**, and then select the app you just created to access its settings page. \
   On the app settings page:
   - Go to **App Credentials**, and copy the app **Client ID** and **Client secret** values.
   - Paste these details to your `.env` file's `clientID` and `clientSecret` variables.
4. From your App Settings page, open the [app manifest editor](https://developers.miro.com/docs/manually-create-an-app#step-2-configure-your-app-in-miro) by clicking **Edit in Manifest**. \
    In the app manifest editor, configure the app as follows:

   - [`redirectUris`](https://developers.miro.com/docs/app-manifest#redirecturis): assign `http://127.0.0.1:5000/callback` as a value for this property. \
     It defines the redirect URL that starts the OAuth 2.0 code grant flow for the REST API.
   - [`scopes`](https://developers.miro.com/docs/app-manifest#scopes): add the permission scopes that users need to grant the app when they install it. \
      To enable the app to read from and write to the board, add the following permissions: - `boards:read` - `boards:write`\
     \
     Hit **Save**.

5. Run the app with `python3 app.py`
6. Open the page at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
