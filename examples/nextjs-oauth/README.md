# Miro Full Stack Example

This sample app demonstrates the use of the Miro REST API and OAuth authorization. After configuring your project outlined in the Prerequisites section, this app allows you to authenticate yourself with your Miro account, and use the related access tokens to make REST API calls via the Miro Developer Platform.

This example also stores your access and refresh tokens in your browsers cookies to demonstrate the Miro's REST API. When storing tokens in your own app, you should be consider encrypting or storing your user's tokens in a more secure way.

## Stack

- [x] React
- [x] Next JS
- [x] Axios
- [x] Miro REST API
- [x] Mirotone (styling)

## Prerequisites

1. Create a [developer team in Miro](https://miro.com/app/dashboard/?createDevTeam=1)
2. Create an [app in Miro](https://miro.com/app/settings/user-profile/apps)
3. Create a board in Miro that you'd like to manipulate using our REST API

## How to start

First, make sure you've handled the prerequisites in full:

- Create a [developer team in Miro](https://miro.com/app/dashboard/?createDevTeam=1)
  - Click the link above, to create a developer team under your account
- Create an [app in Miro](https://miro.com/app/settings/user-profile/apps)
  - From your developer team in Miro, click the "Build Apps" button in the team dashboard UI
  - Name your app, click 'create'
  - Scroll down to 'App Credentials' and copy the client id and client secret — we will use these below in step 4
  - Continue to scroll down to 'Redirect URI for OAuth2.0' and paste in the following redirect url: `http://localhost:3000/api/redirect/`
  - Lastly, scroll down to 'Permissions' and check off the `Board:Read` and `Board:Write` scopes
- Navigate back to your developer team dashboard and create a new board in Miro. Make note of the board ID in the URL of the new board — we will use this below in step 5

Next, we can start working directly with this sample app:

1. Clone or download repo
2. `cd` to root folder
3. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.
4. Create a .env file in the root folder, and set the following variables:

```
clientID={YOUR_CLIENT_ID)
clientSecret={YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET}
redirectURL=http://localhost:3000/api/redirect/
```

5. Navigate to `constants.js` and add the `boardId` of the Miro Board you'd like to leverage/modify
6. Run `yarn dev` to start the local server

Once your server is up and running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser. If the project is running successfully, you should see a 'Sign in' button in the UI.
