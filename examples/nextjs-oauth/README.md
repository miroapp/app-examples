# ☁️ Deploy the app on AWS, Azure, or Netlify <a name="deploy"></a>

If you want to understand how to deploy the app to AWS Amplify or Azure (Static Web Apps), please watch the video below. Otherwise,
skip to the next section to see how to run this locally.

# 🏃🏽‍♂️ Run the app locally <a name="run"></a>

1. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.

2. Rename the `.sample.env` file to `.env` and then add in your clientID, client Secret, and keep the redirect URL the same.

3. Open the [app manifest editor](https://developers.miro.com/docs/manually-create-an-app#step-2-configure-your-app-in-miro) by clicking **Edit in Manifest**. \
   In the app manifest editor, copy and paste the following yaml code:

```yaml
# See https://developers.miro.com/docs/app-manifest on how to use this
appName: NextJS OAuth
sdkUri: "http://localhost:3000"
redirectUris:
  - http://localhost:3000/api/redirect/
scopes:
  - boards:read
  - boards:write
```

4. Run `yarn dev`.

5. Once your server is up and running, go to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.
   If the project is running successfully, you should see a Sign in button in the UI. Then go through the OAuth flow.
   If all went well, you should see `Signed in Successfully`. Great job!
