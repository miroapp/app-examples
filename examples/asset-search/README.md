# 📖 Associated Developer Tutorial <a name="tutorial"></a>

> To view a more in depth developer tutorial

# 🏃🏽‍♂️ Run the app locally <a name="run"></a>

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` to start developing. \
   Your URL should be similar to this example:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
3. Open the [app manifest editor](https://developers.miro.com/docs/manually-create-an-app#step-2-configure-your-app-in-miro) by clicking **Edit in Manifest**. \
    In the app manifest editor, configure the app as follows:

   ```yaml
   appName: Miro Asset Search
   sdkUri: "http://localhost:3000"
   scopes:
     - boards:read
     - boards:write
   ```

   You can read more about Miro's [app manifest on the developer documentation](https://developers.miro.com/docs/app-manifest).

4. Go back to your app home page, and under the `Permissions` section, you will see a blue button that says `Install app and get OAuth token`. Click that button. Then click on `Add` as shown in the video below. <b>In the video we install a different app, but the process is the same regardless of the app.</b>

> ⚠️ We recommend to install your app on a [developer team](https://developers.miro.com/docs/create-a-developer-team) while you are developing or testing apps.⚠️

5. Go to your developer team, and open your boards.
6. Click on the plus icon from the bottom section of your left sidebar. If you hover over it, it will say `More apps`.
7. Search for your app `Asset Search` or whatever you chose to name it. Click on your app to use it, as shown in the video below.
