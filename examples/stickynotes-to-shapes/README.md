## Sticky notes to shapes app

**&nbsp;ℹ&nbsp;Note**:

- We recommend a Chromium-based web browser for local development with HTTP. \
  Safari enforces HTTPS; therefore, it doesn't allow localhost through HTTP.
- All examples use `npm` as a package manager and `npx` as a package runner. \
  If you prefer, you can install and use equivalent alternatives, such as `yarn` or `pnpm`.

### About the app

This app shows how you can select items on the board, and then click the app icon to change the selected sticky notes into shapes.

This app uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). \
To modify the `vite.config.js` configuration, see the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

### How to start locally

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` to start developing. \
   Your URL should be similar to this example:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
3. Open the [app manifest editor](https://developers.miro.com/docs/manually-create-an-app#step-2-configure-your-app-in-miro) by clicking **Edit in Manifest**. \
   In the app manifest editor, configure the app as follows:
   - [`sdkUri`](https://developers.miro.com/docs/app-manifest#sdkuri): assign `http://localhost:3000` as a value for this property. \
     It defines the entry point of the app, and it corresponds to the URL of the server that the app runs on.
   - [`scopes`](https://developers.miro.com/docs/app-manifest#scopes): add the permission scopes that users need to grant the app when they install it. \
     To enable the app to read from and write to the board, add the following permissions:
     - `boards:read`
     - `boards:write`
4. Open a board: you should see your app in the apps toolbar or in the apps panel.

### How to build the app

- Run `npm run build`. \
  This generates a static output inside `dist/`, which you can host on a static hosting service.

### Folder structure

```
.
├── src
│  └── index.js <-- The code for the entry point lives here. For this app, all the logic is contained here.
└── index.html <-- The app entry point. This is the value you assign to 'sdkUri' in the app manifest file.
```
