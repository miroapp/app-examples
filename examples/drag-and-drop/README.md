# Miro Drag and Drop App

## How to start:

- Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install dependencies.
- Run `yarn start` or `npm start` to start developing. \
  Your URL should be similar to this example:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

- Paste this URL in the `App URL` box in your Miro app settings.
- Open a board and click the three dots (...) or the chevron (>>) on the left
  toolbar. You should see the Miro calendar app.

## How to build the app:

- Run `yarn run build` or `npm run build`. \
  This generates a static output inside `dist/`, which you can host on a static hosting service.

## Folder structure

### About the app

This sample app shows how you can generate a calendar consisting of Frames and Text. Built in React off of the [`create-miro-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-miro-app) React/Typescript starter.

This app uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
If you want to modify the `vite.config.js` configuration, see the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).
