# 🏃🏽‍♂️ Run the app locally <a name="run"></a>

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` to start developing. \
   Your URL should be similar to this example:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
3. Open the [app manifest editor](https://developers.miro.com/docs/manually-create-an-app#step-2-configure-your-app-in-miro) by clicking **Edit in Manifest**. \
   In the app manifest editor, configure the app as follows and then click save:

```yaml
# See https://developers.miro.com/docs/app-manifest on how to use this
appName: Drag and Drop
sdkVersion: SDK_V2
sdkUri: http://localhost:3000
scopes:
  - boards:read
  - boards:write
```

4. Go back to your app home page, and under the `Permissions` section, you will see a blue button that says `Install app and get OAuth token`. Click that button. Then click on `Add` as shown in the video below.

> ⚠️ We recommend to install your app on a [developer team](https://developers.miro.com/docs/create-a-developer-team) while you are developing or testing apps.⚠️

6. Click on the plus icon from the bottom section of your left sidebar. If you hover over it, it will say `More apps`.
7. Search for your app `Drag and Drop` or whatever you chose to name it. Click on your app to use it, as shown in the video below.
