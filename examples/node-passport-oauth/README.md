# ✅ Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

- You have a [Miro account](https://miro.com/signup/).
- You're [signed in to Miro](https://miro.com/login/).
- Your Miro account has a [Developer team](https://developers.miro.com/docs/create-a-developer-team).
- Create a [new app in Miro](https://miro.com/app/settings/user-profile/apps)
- Your development environment includes [Node.js 14.13](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or a later version.
- All examples use `npm` as a package manager and `npx` as a package runner.

# 🏃🏽‍♂️ Run the app locally <a name="run"></a>

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

2. Go to [index.mjs lines 33-34](https://github.com/miroapp/app-examples/blob/main/examples/node-passport-oauth/index.mjs#L33-L34)
   and add in your apps `clientID` and `clientSecret` variables. Save the file with the updated variables.

3. Open the [app manifest editor](https://developers.miro.com/docs/manually-create-an-app#step-2-configure-your-app-in-miro) by clicking **Edit in Manifest**. \
   In the app manifest editor, copy and paste the following yaml code:

```yaml
# See https://developers.miro.com/docs/app-manifest on how to use this
appName: Node Passport
redirectUris:
  - http://localhost:4000/auth/miro/callback
scopes:
  - boards:read
```

4. Run `npm start` and your browser should automatically take you to the Miro OAuth page. Once you install the app on a
   developer team, you should see the API response in your browser. Great job!
